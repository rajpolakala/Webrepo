**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Workflow Setup**

**1. Introduction:**
This document outlines the steps required to set up a CI/CD workflow using various tools including SonarQube, Nexus Artifact Repository, and internal FOSS application for security testing and deployment.

**2. Prerequisites:**
- Existing .NET application codebase
- Installed Git for version control
- Jenkins for automation

**3. Steps:**

**Step 1: Set Up Version Control with Git:**
- Create a Git repository for your .NET application.
- Commit your code to the repository.

**Step 2: Configure Jenkins:**
- Install and configure Jenkins on your server.
- Set up Jenkins jobs for building, testing, and deploying your application.

**Step 3: Build and Test:**
- Configure Jenkins job to build your .NET application using MSBuild.
- Integrate unit tests and integration tests into the build process.

**Step 4: Static Code Analysis with SonarQube:**
- Install and configure SonarQube server.
- Integrate SonarQube analysis into your Jenkins build job.
- Analyze the code quality and identify issues.

**Step 5: Nexus Artifact Repository:**
- Install and configure Nexus Repository Manager.
- Configure Jenkins to publish built artifacts to Nexus.

**Step 6: Security Testing with Internal FOSS Application:**
- Set up and configure your internal FOSS application for security testing.
- Integrate security testing into the Jenkins pipeline.

**Step 7: Deployment:**
- Create deployment scripts or use tools like Octopus Deploy for deployment.
- Configure Jenkins job to deploy the application to the desired environment.

**Step 8: Automation and Triggering:**
- Set up triggers to automatically initiate the CI/CD pipeline on code changes or scheduled intervals.

**Step 9: Monitoring and Reporting:**
- Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for failures and successes.
- Generate reports on build, test, and deployment results.

**4. Conclusion:**
By following this document, you'll have set up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for your .NET application using tools like SonarQube, Nexus Artifact Repository, and an internal FOSS application for security testing. This will enhance the development process, improve code quality, and ensure faster and more reliable deployments.
